This is a restaurant shuffling recommendation app implemented on [Little Printer](http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/) Hackday in Carnegie Mellon University.

The app will generate a restaurant randomly chosen from restaurants nearby retrieved from [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/). It can be easily printed out by Little Printer.

##Idea Behind
Life is not always rational, but serendipity. Randomness tends to mean something surprising. People love random choices because they want to be surprised. Shuffling is a good way to randomness. It is everywhere. You may see it in your iPod, [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/) on the web and even people travel just based on what the cheapest flight is right now.

In this app, I just believe people sometimes hate to make a choice. I wish this app would help them. 

Even the app will die soon, but idea never vanishes.

##Implementation
![Layout](http://remote.bergcloud.com/assets/developers/documentation/dimensions.png)

I didn't implement much CSS and Javascript effects with restriction from Little Printer. 
Always remember width, resolution and brightness.

##Contribution

After cloning this app, you should replace google api key and yelp api key in views/hello_world.erb.
